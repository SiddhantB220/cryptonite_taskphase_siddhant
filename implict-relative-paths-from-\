Learnt a new concept: Relative Paths 
Relative paths do not start with / and are realtive to the given current working directory (cwd).
../challenge/run is a new concept where .. refers to the Parent Directory.

An example of relative paths=> (let us assume that / is the cwd then myfile/task1 will be the file relative to it (within it's level)).

I started the task by doing /challenge/run which told me the cwd to cd to (/).
cd / took me to the required cwd (/).
Then I inputted challenge/run which is the relative path to the cwd (/).
