Previously the implict relative path refers to a directly specified path which we had to descend into from the cwd (it is called as naked).
In Explicit relative path, we can move between different directories in the same level 
. refers to same level directory and .. refers to parent directory.

eg-
/././challenge/./././. =>absolute path
././challenge => relative path

To recieve the flag, I changed directory to / using cd /
To refer to the relative path of challenge/run I used ./challenge/run to change flow within the same directory level (/).
